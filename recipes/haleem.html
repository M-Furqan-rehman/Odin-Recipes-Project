        Haleem is a hearty dish made from wheat, lentils, and meat cooked together into a thick porridge-like consistency. <br>Its roots go back to the Middle East and Central Asia, but it became deeply popular in the subcontinent during the Mughal era.<br> In Pakistan, haleem is prepared with a blend of slow-cooked spices and garnished with fried onions, green chilies, ginger, lemon, and coriander.<br> It is often eaten during Muharram, Ramadan, and family gatherings, representing both nourishment and tradition.
